This document describes the technical details of the operating model for the Pacific halibut fishery.  An operating model is a mathematical model used to describe actual resource dynamics in simulation trials and is used to generate resource monitoring data from a known population for use in testing alternative management procedures \citep{Rademeyer2007}.  A management procedure is the combination of pre-defined data, statistical methods in which the data are evaluated, and a rule in which to calculate a Total Allowable Catch (TAC).  Lastly, Management Strategy Evaluation, or Management Procedure Evaluation, is the process by which alternative procedures are simulation tested and evaluated using performance metrics that are related to Management Objectives.
