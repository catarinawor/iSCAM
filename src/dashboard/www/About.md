The objective of this application is to examine alternative harvest policies for Pacific halibut fisheries. At present, there are two Apps for exploring alternative harvest policies.  

The Equilibrium App is simple age- sex- and size-structured equilibrium model for exploring the long-term, or equilibrium, conditions for a given harvest policy.  The interface allows the user to compare two alternative procedures and examine equilibrium values of many different variables over a range of fishing mortality rates in the directed fishery.  Equilibrium models are widely used in setting harvest policies.


More information about each of the apps is available on the menu to the left.
